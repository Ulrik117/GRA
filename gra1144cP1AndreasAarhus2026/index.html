		<h2>Toad In The Hole</h2>
		<p>Toad in the hole (also called Egg in a Basket or Bull's Eye) is a simple, classic breakfast where a hole is cut in a slice of bread, buttered, and then pan-fried with an egg cracked into the opening, cooking both the bread and egg together, often with the small bread circle toasted alongside. It's a popular, fun way to enjoy toast and eggs, resulting in a runny yolk perfect for dipping.  </p>
